0.5.0 - 2023-12-04
==================

Added
-----

*   Support a top-level ``exclusions`` key to exclude specific files.

Changed
-------

*   Rename the ``"extension"`` configuration key to ``"extensions"``.

Documentation
-------------

*   Add Changelog, License, and Colophon pages.
*   Fix TOML syntax in a code sample.
*   Add a link to the Chipshot repository.

Development
-----------

*   Add a Dependabot configuration to auto-update GitHub action versions.
*   Add more check-jsonschema pre-commit hooks.

.. _changelog-0.4.0:

0.4.0 - 2023-11-30
==================

Fixed
-----

*   Fix file writing, which wasn't rendering newlines correctly.

Changed
-------

*   Determine the configured file encoding only if the file has content.

Documentation
-------------

*   Document how to create a new custom style.

.. _changelog-0.3.0:

0.3.0 - 2023-11-29
==================

Fixed
-----

*   Fix a bug that prevented existing headers from being found
    if they followed a document prologue.

Changed
-------

*   Standardize how configurations for styles, prologues, and templates are found.

    This helps ensure that the most specific configuration for a given file is always used.
    For example, code interacting with a file with two extensions (like ``.jinja.html``)
    will consistently find a configuration for ``.jinja.html`` before ``.html``.

*   Rename ``prolog`` to ``prologue`` everywhere.

*   Rename the configuration keys ``style`` and ``prolog`` to ``styles`` and ``prologues``.

*   Eliminate the ``"default"`` config key.

Development
-----------

*   Add a workflow that tests Chipshot using GitHub actions.

.. _changelog-0.2.0:

0.2.0 - 2023-11-28
==================

Added
-----

*   Add two pre-commit hooks: ``check-headers`` and ``update-headers``.

Changed
-------

*   Allow template literals in the config file using the ``template`` key.

    Paths to template files can be defined in the ``template_path`` key.

*   When no configuration file is specified,
    ``.chipshot.toml`` will be loaded first (if it exists).

    ``pyproject.toml`` will still be loaded as a fallback
    if ``.chipshot.toml`` doesn't exist.

*   Rename the ``--debug`` flag to ``--verbose``.

Documentation
-------------

*   Add initial documentation.

    that are sufficiently dissimilar to the rendered header.
*   Detect and retain existing prologues in files
    (like hashbangs in scripts, or XML declarations).
*   Support custom header styles by file extension.
