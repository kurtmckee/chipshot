.. _changelog-0.3.0:

0.3.0 - 2023-11-29
==================

Fixed
-----

*   Fix a bug that prevented existing headers from being found
    if they followed a document prologue.

Changed
-------

*   Standardize how configurations for styles, prologues, and templates are found.

    This helps ensure that the most specific configuration for a given file is always used.
    For example, code interacting with a file with two extensions (like ``.jinja.html``)
    will consistently find a configuration for ``.jinja.html`` before ``.html``.

*   Rename ``prolog`` to ``prologue`` everywhere.

*   Rename the configuration keys ``style`` and ``prolog`` to ``styles`` and ``prologues``.

*   Eliminate the ``"default"`` config key.

Development
-----------

*   Add a workflow that tests Chipshot using GitHub actions.

.. _changelog-0.2.0:

0.2.0 - 2023-11-28
==================

Added
-----

*   Add two pre-commit hooks: ``check-headers`` and ``update-headers``.

Changed
-------

*   Allow template literals in the config file using the ``template`` key.

    Paths to template files can be defined in the ``template_path`` key.

*   When no configuration file is specified,
    ``.chipshot.toml`` will be loaded first (if it exists).

    ``pyproject.toml`` will still be loaded as a fallback
    if ``.chipshot.toml`` doesn't exist.

*   Rename the ``--debug`` flag to ``--verbose``.

Documentation
-------------

*   Add initial documentation.

.. _changelog-0.1.0:

0.1.0 - 2023-11-24
==================

Initial release
---------------

*   Support Python 3.8 and higher.
*   Detect and retain existing byte order marks in files.
*   Detect and retain existing newlines in files.
*   Detect and retain existing headers in files
    that are sufficiently dissimilar to the rendered header.
*   Detect and retain existing prologues in files
    (like hashbangs in scripts, or XML declarations).
*   Support custom header styles by file extension.
